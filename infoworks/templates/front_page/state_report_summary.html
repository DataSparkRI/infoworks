      <h4><b>Total Population of Students and Schools in Rhode Island</b></h4>
      <p class="description">
         Data summarizing the number of students and schools are
         presented by education level â€” elementary, middle, or high
         school. A small number of public schools have more than one level,
         such as kindergarten through eighth grade, and are shown as
         "elementary/middle schools". The schools data are also summarized by
         "type of school" to show the number of traditional public schools,
         public charters (either independently operated or by a district),
         schools operated by the state and collaborative schools that involve
         multiple districts.
